# Making Things Interactive - Project 00
This repo contains Project 00 of the "Making Things Interactive - Spring 2017" course.

Answers to Question 1 to 5 can be found in the different folders. They have been written as Processing (which I used here for the first time) PDE files.

You can also find a "Media" folder in which screenshots and screen recordings have been put.

### Some more details
For question 3, I opted for an easing function as the one I found in Processing documentation.

For question 4, two of the circles move based on an easing function but one of them only starts moving is the mouse stays still. The last circle gets to the mouse cursor with a constant speed.

For question 5, I decided to recreate Boomshine.

## Credits and sources

As a newbie to Processing, almost all of my code has been written referring to Processing documentation available [here](https://processing.org/reference/).

In particular, the bulk of my code for Question 3 was inspired by the [Easing example code](https://processing.org/examples/easing.html).

For Question 5, I adapted the code that had been made available by the Indiana University School of Informatics. It can be found [here](http://music.informatics.indiana.edu/courses/H211/class_examples/boomshine/applet/boomshine.pde).
