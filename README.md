# Making Things Interactive - Project00
This repo contains Project 00 of the "Making Things Interactive - Spring 2017" course.

Answers to Question 1 to 4 can be found in the different folders of this repo. They have been written as Processing (which I used here for the first time) PDE files.

You can also find a "Medias" folder in which screenshots or screen recordings have been put.

## Credits and sources

As a newbie in Processing, almost all of my code has been written referring to Processing documentation available [here](https://processing.org/reference/).

In particular, the bulk of my code for Question 3 was inspired by the [Easing example code](https://processing.org/examples/easing.html).
